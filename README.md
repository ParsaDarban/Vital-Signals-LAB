# EOG
In the first experiment, we examine EOG signals. In this experiment, we focus on analyzing eye movement without head movement and conduct tests such as the field of view and its relationship with corneal movement, nystagmus, fast tracking, and slow tracking. We analyze the EOG signal, its amplitude, and identify various parameters.

# Blood pressure
In the second experiment, we investigate the relationship between blood pressure and the pulse pressure received from the finger and big toe. The effects of height change on blood pressure and its relationship with the signals received from the overall function of diastole and systole are the objectives of the experiment.
