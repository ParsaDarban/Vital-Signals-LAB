In the first experiment, we examine EOG signals. In this experiment, we focus on analyzing eye movement without head movement and conduct tests such as the field of view and its relationship with corneal movement, nystagmus, fast tracking, and slow tracking. We analyze the EOG signal, its amplitude, and identify various parameters.
